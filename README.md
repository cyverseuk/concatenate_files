# Concatenate files

![docker badge]()

This application will use a base Ubuntu Docker image (16.04 at the time of writing) to concatenate multiple files.  
*Please note ATM this WILL NOT work in the DE, there's an open ticket to support multiple file selection in the DE for Agave applications. In the meanwhile you can use it via the <a href="https://cyverseuk.herokuapp.com/">CyVerse @EI webapp</a> or submit jobs via command line writing a JSON file.*
